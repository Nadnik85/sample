# Introduction
The goal of the this project is to create and maintain "Very Vanilla Live", a ban-safe and reliable version of MacroQuest2 made with Redguides' community plugins, modifications, and macros.

We're currently supporting Test, Live, and EMU with this compile.

# Getting Started
Information about installing Very Vanilla can be found on RedGuides.com. Specifically, right here:

# Build and Test
You can create your own "lite" version of Very Vanilla by using the code here, combined with the source for MacroQuest2 which can be cloned here:

If you're new to compiling, you can find instructions here:

# Contribute
We love contributors! If you're testing changes, feel free to create or request a new branch for your project.

Not everything has to be MQ2 related, we've hosted many other programs for EverQuest in the past and we want to see them here.

# Git Guide
If you've never used git before, GitHub has a nice little tutorial:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
You can even use their "GitHub Desktop" client with our Gitlab repository. Most developers in the MQ2 scene use Visual Studio to connect to git, which is also free.

# Access

If you'd like to keep your work private, a special plugin for example, or if you need access to code not shown here, send a PM to Redbot.
