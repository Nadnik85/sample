# Introduction
The goal of the this project is to create and maintain "Very Vanilla Live", a ban-safe and reliable version of MacroQuest2 made with Redguides community plugins, modifications, and macros.

We're currently supporting Test, Live, and EMU with this compile.

# Getting Started
Information about installing Very Vanilla can be found on RedGuides.com. Specifically, right here:

https://www.redguides.com/forums/threads/26389-MacroQuest2-Beginner-s-Guide-(start-here)

# Build and Test
The source for MacroQuest2 can be found at MacroQuest2.com. You can find a great document right here explaining how to compile MQ2:

http://www.macroquest2.com/wiki/index.php/MacroQuest2:Compiling

If you're building Very Vanilla, you can download and compile locally, or compile here in VSTS.
To compile in VSTS: go to Build & Release. If you have the proper permissions, you should be able to build (assuming our agent is running, which is held on a private server).
When the build is finished, go to "artifacts" and download "drop", the release will be inside.
If you'd like MQ2Nav, you must compile it yourself.

# Contribute

There are several ways to connect to version control.

The easiest way is to connect with us is via DropBox, a free app that works on all systems. 
On the Redguides forums, PM Redbot and let him know you'd like to be added to the creator's Dropbox. 
Once you have access, everything added to the Dropbox will make its way to our version control, and the next Very Vanilla release.

A superior way, which will give you actual version control features, is to connect through Visual Studio. Our URL is:
https://redbot.visualstudio.com
PM me for the login and password.

There are several other ways to connect to version control as well, outlined here:

## Visual Studio Guide
The community edition of Visual Studio is free and can be downloaded here:
https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

After that you can connect by using the guide here:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/connect-to-visual-studio-team-services#vs

Or read my quick guide:
After installing Visual Studio, go to "Team Explorer" and then "Manage Connections" (it's a plug icon), and click 

"Manage Connections" -> Connect to team project -> Servers -> Add

connect to the following URL: https://redbot.visualstudio.com

Enter the login details that Redbot PM'ed you (you may switch users on the bottom left of "Connect to team project" page)

You should be connected to Very Vanilla Live, and can "check out" and edit the code there. 
When done, go to Team Explorer -> Pending Changes -> and Check In.

If you have any issues, post in the Creator's forum and we'll get you set up.

# Access

We keep most of our plugins hidden, but if you'd like to help on a specific plugin, let the admins know in the creator's forum and we'll clear you for access.
