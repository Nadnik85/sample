# Contribute

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

If you're a contributor and feel you're ready for it, contact RedBot for the "creator" user rank on RedGuides.com

Not every contribution has to be MQ2 related, we've hosted many other programs for EverQuest. Feel free to add them here in their own folder, see "EQBackupRestore" for an example of a non-MQ2 project.

If you're contributing something new, or know about good EverQuest software that we don't, please create a "resource" for it here:
